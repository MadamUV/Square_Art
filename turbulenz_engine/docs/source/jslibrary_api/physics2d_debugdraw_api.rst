=============================
The Physics2DDebugDraw Object
=============================

Provides fast line based, GPU powered drawing API for 2d debug drawing, and drawing
of Physics2D physics data.

Coordinates of the DebugDraw object are that of Physics2D, with scaling to pixels
defined solely by the viewports set on this object.

**Required scripts**

The Physics2DDevice object requires::

    /*{{ javascript("jslib/physics2ddevice.js") }}*/
    /*{{ javascript("jslib/physics2ddebugdraw.js") }}*/


Constructor
===========

**Summary**

Create a :ref:`DebugDraw <physics2d_debug>` object.

DebugDraw object uses the :ref:`GraphicsDevice <graphicsdevice>` object to render line based primitives on the GPU with methods for rendering a
Physics2D World and other Physics2D objects.

**Syntax** ::

    var debug = Physics2DDebugDraw.create({
        graphicsDevice : gd
    });

``graphicsDevice``
    The :ref:`GraphicsDevice <graphicsdevice>` object for the debug draw to use.



Methods
=======

.. index::
    pair: DebugDraw; setPhysics2DViewport

`setPhysics2DViewport`
----------------------

**Summary**

Define the region in Physics2D coordinates that is to be drawn to the screen.

This method will take effect upon the next call to `debug.begin()`.

**Syntax** ::

    debug.setPhysics2DViewport(rectangle);

``rectangle``
    The rectangle in Physics2D coordinates to be drawn.

    If using :ref:`Draw2D <draw2d>` in conjunction with Physics2D, then as long as your graphics logic uses the same coordinates as Physics2D you would most likely find that using the value of `draw2D.getViewport()` is the best fit for the Physics2D viewport so that debug drawing is correctly aligned.


.. index::
    pair: DebugDraw; setScreenViewport

`setScreenViewport`
-------------------

**Summary**

Define the region in screen pixels (with top-left corner at (0,0)) to which the
Physics2D viewport will be mapped onto.

Anything outside of this region will be clipped.

**Syntax** ::

    debug.setScreenViewport(rectangle);

``rectangle``
    The rectangle in screen pixels to be drawn to.

    If using :ref:`Draw2D <draw2d>` in conjunction with Physics2D, then you would most likely find that using the value of `draw2D.getScreenSpaceViewport()` is the best fit for the Screen viewport so that debug drawing is correctly aligned.

    pair: DebugDraw; begin

`begin`
-------

**Summary**

Begin debug drawing state.

This call will update shader parameters for drawing based on viewports, as well as setting the scissor on the graphics device.
