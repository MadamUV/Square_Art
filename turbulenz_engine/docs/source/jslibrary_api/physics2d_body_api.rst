====================
The RigidBody Object
====================

Rigid bodies come in 3 different types:

 * `'static'`: This type of body, once added to a :ref:`World <physics2d_world>` may no longer be mutated in any way (Changing position, changing shapes) except where documented.

 * `'kinematic'`: This type of body is equivalent to a static type, except that it is permitted to move (And will always move to exactly where it is told). Kinematic bodies should be moved by modifying their velocity as changing position directly will be equivalent to teleporting the body.

 * `'dynamic'`: This type of body has non-infinite mass/inertia (Unless explicitly set as such) and is under the influence of gravity, collision and constraint impulses.


Constructor
===========

A RigidBody object can be constructed with :ref:`Physics2DDevice.createRigidBody <physics2ddevice_createbody>`.

    pair: RigidBody; wake

`wake`
------

**Summary**

Waking a rigid body in Physics2D is not generally required. It is only ever required to manually wake a rigid body, if you manually put it to sleep or added it as a sleeping body.

Mutations to the body, and interactions with other bodies in the world will otherwise automatically wake the body.

**Syntax** ::

    body.wake();

.. index::
    pair: RigidBody; sleep

``bounds``
    If specified, the bounds of this body will be stored in this array, otherwise a new array will be created.

Translate the Shapes of this body, in local coordinate system so that the center of mass of this body as computed by `computeLocalCentreOfMass` is equal to `[0, 0]`.

It is important for a rigid body to be aligned with the origin to behave intuitively.

This method will be ignored for `static` type bodies which are inside of a World or if it is made during a simulation step.

**Syntax** ::

    body.alignWithOrigin();


.. index::
    pair: RigidBody; integrate

`integrate`
-----------

**Summary**

Perform an integration of this body's position and rotation based the bodies current velocities.

This method will be ignored for `static` type bodies which are inside of a World or if it is made during a simulation step.

**Syntax** ::

    var success = body.addEventListener(eventType, handler);

``eventType``
    One of:

    `'wake'`
       Issued when this rigid body was woken. This event is not generated when using the wake() method manually.

    `'sleep'`
       Issued when this rigid body goes to sleep. This event is not generated when using the sleep() methods manually.

``handler``
    Function to be called when this event occurs (Noting that events as usual are deferred until the end of world `step()`).

    Function is called with no arguments, and with its `this` object as the :ref:`RigidBody <physics2d_body>` to which the event relates.

This function will fail, and return `false` if the event type was not accepted, or if the handler already exists for the given event type.

Example: ::

    function wakeHandler() {
        console.log("Body named: " + this.userData.name+" woke up!");
    }

    var body = phys2D.createRigidBody({
        ...
        userData : {
            name : "Box no. 1"
        }
    });
    body.addEventListener('wake', wakeHandler);

You may add as many handlers for a given event type as you wish, and handlers will be called in the same order in which they were added.

`removeEventListener`
---------------------

**Summary**

Remove existing event listener from this Body.

**Syntax** ::

    var success = body.removeEventListener(eventType, handler);

This function will fail, and return `false` if the event type was not accepted, or if the handler was not found on the body for the given event type.


Properties
==========

.. index::
    pair: RigidBody; shapes

`shapes`
--------

The set of :ref:`Shape <physics2d_shape>` objects assigned to this body.

Adding and removing shapes from this body will mutate this list and should be avoided during iteration. To remove all :ref:`Shape <physics2d_shape>` objects from this Body, you may use the following pattern: ::

    var shapes = body.shapes;
    while (shapes.length > 0)
    {
        body.removeShape(shapes[0]);
    }

.. note:: Read Only.

.. index::
    pair: RigidBody; constraints

`constraints`
-------------

The set of :ref:`Constraint <physics2d_constraint>` objects making use of this body which are presently part of a simulation World.

Adding and removing constraints from the world will mutate this list and should be avoided during iteration. To remove all :ref:`Constraint <physics2d_constraint>` objects from the world which make us of this Body, you may use the following pattern: ::

    var constraints = body.constraints;
    while (constraints.length > 0)
    {
        world.removeConstraint(constraints[0]);
    }

This action is performed automatically when removing the Body itself from the simulation world.

-------

The :ref:`World <physics2d_world>` object this rigid body has been assigned to.

.. note:: Read Only.

.. index::
    pair: RigidBody; bullet

`bullet`
----------

Whether this body is marked for continuous collisions against other dynamic bodies. Due to implementation details it is advised not to create a group of bullet objects that interact together as there may be visual stalling.

.. index::
    pair: RigidBody; userData

`userData`
----------

Field to which you may assign whatever data you like.
