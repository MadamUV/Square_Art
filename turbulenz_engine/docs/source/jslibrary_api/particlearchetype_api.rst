============================
The ParticleArchetype Object
============================

**Added SDK 0.28.0**

The `ParticleArchetype` is used to fully describe a particle system for use with the :ref:`ParticleManager <particlemanager>`. An archetype is constructed from an easily serializable data description, whose format is described as below.

Serialization and deserialization of the archetypes should be done using the methods on :ref:`ParticleManager <particlemanager>` which will both serialize and compress the archetype description to reduce file sizes.

This data description does not require every field to be specified, as part of this data-driven API, the individual components of the particle systems will verify the structure of the input description, filling in missing fields with default values and reporting useful errors and/or warnings when the input description is in error.

The values shown above, are the basic default values for an archetype description.

``system``
    Parameters of the :ref:`ParticleSystems <particlesystem>` that will be created for an instance of this archetype.

    ``center`` (Default `[0, 0, 0]`)
        The center of the particle system's local extents. The extents of the particle systems limit the positions of particles within the systems, and provide a means of culling non-visible systems in a :ref:`Scene <scene>`.

    ``halfExtents`` (Default `[1, 1, 1]`)
        The local half-extents of the particle system.

    ``maxParticles`` (Optional)
        The maximum number of particles the system will be able to hold. The absolute maximum value for this property is `65536`.

        If unspecified, this value will be computed from the archetype emitters.

    ``maxSpeed`` (Optional)
        The maximum speed (in local coordinates) achievable for a particle in the system. This field is required to define a suitable normalization of particle velocities into texture storage for the GPU.

        If unspecified, this value will be computed from the archetype emitters.

    ``maxLifeTime`` (Optional)
        The maximum time for which any particle in the system will be able to live for. This field is required to define a suitable normalization of particle life-times into texture storage for the GPU.

        If unspecified, this value will be computed from the archetype emitters.

    ``zSorted`` (Default `false`)
        Whether this system will have its views z-sorted for correct alpha-blending. Enabling z-sorting for a system will have performance implications with sorting performed on the GPU through a sequence of draw calls that iteratively improve the sorting of the view, the additional cost may be severe for larger particle systems.

    ``maxSortSteps`` (Default `136`)
        The maximum number of draw calls to make in any frame to sort a particle system. The actual number will be no more than is required to completely sort the system (Of which `136` is the amount needed to completely sort a system with `65536` particles. Aka, the default value for `maxSortSteps` indicates a complete sort for all values of `maxParticles`).

    ``trackingEnabled`` (Default `false`)
        If true, then particles are able to be co-simulated on the CPU when requested. This will enable more complex emitters to function.

        .. NOTE::
            No pre-defined emitter requires this.

``renderer``
    Parameters of the :ref:`ParticleRenderer <particlerenderer>` that will be used for this archetype.

    ``name`` (Default `"default"`)
        The name of a registered :ref:`ParticleRenderer <particlerenderer>`.

    Other parameters for this object depend on the specific :ref:`ParticleRenderer <particlerenderer>` in use.

    By default, there are 4 registered renderers defined for a manager:

    * `"default"`
        A :ref:`DefaultParticleRenderer <defaultparticlerenderer>` using the `alpha` blend-mode.
    * `"alpha"`
        Same as `"default"`.
    * `"additive"`
         A :ref:`DefaultParticleRenderer <defaultparticlerenderer>` using the `additive` blend-mode.
    * `"opaque"`
        A :ref:`DefaultParticleRenderer <defaultparticlerenderer>` using the `opaque` blend-mode.

    The parameters supported for the archetype by these renderers are listed and described :ref:`here <defaultparticlerenderer_archetype>`. You may also find its `createUserData` function to be useful.

``updaters``
    Parameters of the :ref:`ParticleUpdater <particleupdater>` that will be created for this archetype.

    ``name`` (Default `"default"`)
        The name of a registered :ref:`ParticleUpdater <particleupdater>`.

    By default, there is a single updater defined for a manager:

    * `"default"`
        A :ref:`DefaultParticleUpdater <defaultparticleupdater>`.

    The parameters supported for the archetype by this updater are listed and described :ref:`here <defaultparticleupdater_archetype>`. You may also find use of its `createUserData` function to be useful.

``synchronizer``
    Parameters of the :ref:`ParticleSynchronizer <particlesynchronizer>` that will be created for each system of this archetype.

    ``name`` (Default `"default"`)
        The name of a registered :ref:`ParticleSynchronizer <particlesynchronizer>`.

    By default, there is a single synchronizer defined for a manager.

    * `"default"`
        A :ref:`DefaultParticleSynchronizer <defaultparticlesynchronizer>`.

    The parameters supported for the archetype by this synchronizer are listed and described :ref:`here <defaultparticlesynchronizer_archetype>`.

``animationSystem`` (Default `"default"`)
    The animation system used by particle animations in the archetype.

    By default, there is a single animation system compatible with all pre-defined updaters and renderers.

    * `"default"`
        The default animation system, as specified :ref:`here <defaultparticlesystem>`

``packedTexture0..N``
    These parameters of the archetype can be used to specify that pre-packed textures exist containing all flip-book animations of every particle in the archetype, and that this texture should be used in-place of run-time packed textures generated by the manager.

    Indices should match the particle animation system in use, noting that `packedTexture0` is permitted to be defined by the name `packedTexture` instead.

    If a packed texture is defined, then particles in the archetype will be permitted to have a corresponding `texture-uv0..N` field specifying a normalized uv-rectangle of the packed texture to be used in re-mapping particle animation uv-rectangles as described in :ref:`ParticleBuilder.compiler <particlebuilder>` (`uvMap` parameter). If this field is not specified then `[0, 0, 1, 1]` will be implied, indicating the particle animation is already aware of how the textures are packed.

    If a packed texture is not specified, then particles in the archetype should themselves specify the textures to be used for that particle that the manager may pack them at run-time.

``particles``
    A dictionary of named particle animations usable by the particle system.

    Each field of this object is the name of the particle to be referenced by emitters, and a description of that particle with the following fields:

    ``animation`` (Default `"default"`)
        The name of a registered particle animation in the manager. The default particle animation is a single frame animation specifying no attribute values (Indicating the system defaults will be filled in). This animation will have a reported life time of `0`.

        Particle animations are described in :ref:`ParticleBuilder.compile <particlebuilder>` (`particles` parameter).

    ``tweaks``
       A dictionary of tweaks (As described in :ref:`ParticleBuilder.compile <particlebuilder>` `tweaks` parameters), to be applied to the animation for this particle.

    ``texture-uv0..N``
        A normalized uv-rectangle describing the sub-set of the packed texture to which this particles defined animation uv-rectangles should be mapped to as described in :ref:`ParticleBuilder.compile <particlebuilder>` `uvMap` parameter.

        If using a corresponding packed texture, and this field is omitted, then `[0, 0, 1, 1`] will be used.

        If not using a corresponding packed texture, this field must not be present.

    ``texture0..N``
        A texture to be used for this individual particle including its entire flip-book animation if applicable.

        This field must not be present if using packed textures.

        This fields value should be a `string` specifying the path to the texture used for this particle.

        If not using a corresponding packed texture, and this field is omitted, then the :ref:`TextureManager <texturemanager>` default texture will be used.

``emitters``
    An array of :ref:`ParticleEmitters <particleemitter>` for this particle system archetype.

    ``name`` (Default `"default"`)
        The name of a registered :ref:`ParticleEmitter <particleemitter>`.

    By default, there is a single emitter defined for a manager:

    * `"default"`
        A :ref:`DefaultParticleEmitter <defaultparticleemitter>`.

    The parameters supported for the archetype by this emitter are listed and described :ref:`here <defaultparticleemitter_archetype>`.
