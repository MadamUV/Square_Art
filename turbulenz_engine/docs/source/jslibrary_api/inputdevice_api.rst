----------------------
The InputDevice Object
----------------------

``InputDevice`` provides support for keyboard, mouse, gamepad and touch input events.
It queues input events received between
consecutive calls to :ref:`update<inputdevice-update>`. When
:ref:`update<inputdevice-update>` is called, the events are dispatched
in order using the appropriate event handlers and the event queue is
cleared.

The ``InputDevice`` also allows the game to :ref:`hide<inputdevice-hideMouse>`/:ref:`show<inputdevice-showMouse>` the mouse cursor
and lock its position (by calling
:ref:`lockMouse<inputdevice-lockMouse>`).

Event Handling
==============

For each HID supported, there are three main event types: down events,
up events, and move events. Down events occur when a button/key is
pressed, up events when a button/key is released and move events occur
when the HID is moved, or an analogue control on it (e.g. thumbstick)
is adjusted. Such events include:

* :ref:`keydown <inputdevice-keydown>`/:ref:`keyup <inputdevice-keyup>` events
* :ref:`mousedown <inputdevice-mousedown>`/:ref:`mouseup <inputdevice-mouseup>` events
* :ref:`mousemove <inputdevice-mousemove>` events (When mouse is :ref:`locked<inputdevice-lockMouse>`)
* :ref:`paddown <inputdevice-paddown>`/:ref:`padup <inputdevice-padup>` events
* :ref:`padmove <inputdevice-padmove>` events
* :ref:`touchstart <inputdevice-touchstart>`/:ref:`touchend <inputdevice-touchend>` events
* :ref:`touchmove <inputdevice-touchmove>` events

In addition, the following events are supported:

* :ref:`focus<inputdevice-focus>`/:ref:`blur<inputdevice-blur>` events
* :ref:`mouseenter<inputdevice-mouseenter>`/:ref:`mouseover <inputdevice-mouseover>`/:ref:`mouseleave<inputdevice-mouseleave>` events
* :ref:`mousewheel<inputdevice-mousewheel>` events
* :ref:`mouselocklost<inputdevice-mouselocklost>` events
* :ref:`touchenter <inputdevice-touchenter>`/:ref:`touchleave <inputdevice-touchleave>`/:ref:`touchcancel <inputdevice-touchcancel>` events

Focus and blur events occur when the TurbulenzEngine object gains or
loses focus. Clicking on the TurbulenzEngine object gives it focus,
and clicking elsewhere or switching window (or tab) causes it to lose
focus.

.. NOTE::

    Unless otherwise specified, events of a certain type are only received when the TurbulenzEngine has focus; the
    events not requiring focus are: :ref:`mouseenter<inputdevice-mouseenter>`,
    :ref:`mouseleave<inputdevice-mouseleave>`, :ref:`mouseover<inputdevice-mouseover>`,
    :ref:`mouseup<inputdevice-mouseup>`, and :ref:`mousedown<inputdevice-mousedown>`.

Event handlers are added and removed using
:ref:`addEventListener<inputdevice-addeventlistener>` and
:ref:`removeEventListener<inputdevice-removeeventlistener>`.  Multiple
event listeners may be added for each event type.


Control Codes
=============

In general, a human interface device (HID) such as a mouse or
keyboard, has a number of "controls" which the user can interact with
to produce input events. Each control (e.g. mouse button, keyboard
key) has an associated "control code".  These allow the game to
identify input consistently and clearly. Keyboard, mouse and pad
control codes are referred to as `KeyCodes`, `MouseCodes`, and
`PadCodes` respectively.

The keyboard is treated as a game controller rather than a text entry
device. Each keyboard control code (KeyCode) therefore corresponds to
an individual physical key on the keyboard (i.e. a control) and not
the text character that would result from such a key press. For
instance, pressing "Q" on the US keyboard will result in the same
KeyCode as pressing "A" on a French keyboard (as they are in the same
physical location on the keyboard). The names of the KeyCodes
correspond to the names of the keys on the US keyboard and in the
example above, the KeyCode generated would be "Q". For reference,
please see the US keyboard `here:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KB_United_States-NoAltGr.svg>`_

.. NOTE::

    The Escape key is reserved for unlocking the user's mouse and
    exiting fullscreen, and pressing it or releasing it causes no key
    events to be sent. In general, keys which are not currently part
    of the mapping scheme will not send events and cannot be used by
    the game.

.. WARNING::

    Keyboards exist with a wide variety of different keys. It is
    strongly recommended to only use the most common keys as part of
    any default control scheme. A list of standard keys are shown in
    the :ref:`KeyCode table <inputdevice-keycodetable>` section.

Using controls rather than characters for keyboard input has the
advantage that game code written will work for all keyboard layouts
without the need for localization; there is no need for multiple
versions of input code for each keyboard layout a game wishes to
support.

It may be necessary to convert from KeyCodes to the Unicode character
which would result from pressing that physical key with the userâ€™s
keyboard layout e.g. when localizing the game controls displayed to
the user. The InputDevice API provides the function
:ref:`convertToUnicode <inputdevice-converttounicode>` for this
reason. In order to facilitate correct translation of in-game text,
and correct formatting of dates and numbers, the locale of the player
can be requested using the :ref:`TurbluenzEngine.getSystemInfo
<turbulenzengine_getSystemInfo>` function.


Methods
=======

.. _inputdevice-update:

`update`
--------

**Summary**

Iterates through the events in the event queue calling the relevant callbacks. Once all events have been dispatched, the
event queue is cleared.

.. NOTE::

    This behavior is different when running in canvas; in canvas mode, events are dispatched to handlers the moment
    they are received. To maintain compatibility with both modes, any clearing of input states carried out by the game
    should take place after input has been handled each frame.

.. NOTE::
    The plugin version requires the :ref:`GraphicsDevice <graphicsdevice>` to have been created for the InputDevice to generate events.

**Syntax** ::

    inputDevice.update();


.. _inputdevice-addeventlistener:

`addEventListener`
------------------

**Summary**

Adds an event listener for the specified event. Multiple event listeners may be added for each event type. Adding the
same event listener twice has no effect - the event listener will still only be called once per event.

**Syntax** ::

    var eventType = 'mouseleave';
    var eventListener = function onMouseLeave()
    {
        game.pause();
    }
    inputDevice.addEventListener(eventType, eventListener);


``eventType``
    A valid :ref:`event type <inputdevice-eventypes>` string.

``eventListener``
    Callback associated with events of eventType.

.. _inputdevice-removeeventlistener:


`removeEventListener`
---------------------

**Summary**

Removes an event listener for the specified event. If the event listener supplied was never added using
:ref:`addEventListener <inputdevice-addeventlistener>`, this has no effect.

**Syntax** ::

    inputDevice.removeEventListener(eventType, eventListener);


``eventType``
    A valid :ref:`event type <inputdevice-eventypes>` string.

``eventListener``
    Callback associated with events of eventType.


.. _inputdevice-lockmouse:

`lockMouse`
-----------

**Summary**

Locks the mouse cursor position and hides the cursor. Fails if the
cursor is not over the TurbulenzEngine object or if the
TurbulenzEngine object is not focused. Returns true or false to
indicate success or failure.

.. NOTE::

    When locked, :ref:`mousemove <inputdevice-mousemove>` events rather than
    :ref:`mouseover <inputdevice-mouseover>` events will be received for mouse movement.

**Syntax** ::

    if (!inputDevice.lockMouse())
    {
        // Failed to lockMouse (mouse is not over the TurbulenzEngine object)
    }


.. _inputdevice-unlockmouse:

`unlockMouse`
-------------

**Summary**

Unlocks the mouse cursor (reverses a `lockMouse` call) and reshows the mouse
cursor if it was not hidden before the call to `lockMouse`.  Fails if
the cursor is not currently locked. Returns true or false to indicate
success or failure.

**Syntax** ::

    if (!inputDevice.unlockMouse())
    {
        // Failed to unlockMouse (mouse was not already locked)
    }


.. _inputdevice-islocked:

`isLocked`
----------

**Summary**

Returns true if the mouse is currently locked, false otherwise.

**Syntax** ::

    if (!inputDevice.isLocked())
    {
        inputDevice.lockMouse();
    }


.. _inputdevice-hidemouse:

`hideMouse`
-----------

**Summary**

Hides the cursor if it is currently visible (not locked) and over the
TurbulenzEngine object; fails otherwise. Returns true or false to
indicate success or failure. When the mouse is locked the mouse cursor
is already hidden, this function will have no effect and will return
false.

**Syntax** ::

    if (!inputDevice.hideMouse())
    {
        // Failed to hideMouse (it was either locked, already hidden,
        // or outside of the TurbulenzEngine object)
    }


.. _inputdevice-showmouse:

`showMouse`
------------

**Summary**

Shows the cursor if it is currently hidden and not locked; fails
otherwise. Returns true or false to indicate success or failure.

It is an error to call this function while the mouse is locked, and it
will not affect the visibility of the mouse after subsequent calls to
`unlockMouse`.

**Syntax** ::

    if (!inputDevice.showMouse())
    {
        // Failed to showMouse (it was either already visible, or locked)
    }


.. _inputdevice-ishidden:

`isHidden`
-------------

**Summary**

Returns true if the mouse is currently hidden (including when locked), false
otherwise.

**Syntax** ::

    if (!inputDevice.isHidden())
    {
        inputDevice.hideMouse();
    }


.. _inputdevice-isfocused:

`isFocused`
-------------

**Summary**

Returns true if the TurbulenzEngine object is currently focused, false otherwise.

**Syntax** ::

    var isFocused = inputDevice.isFocused();


.. _inputdevice-converttounicode:

`convertToUnicode`
------------------

**Summary**

Converts a given array of KeyCodes to an object of the Unicode characters which would result from pressing those
physical keys with the user's keyboard layout. Returns null if the argument passed in is not an array. For KeyCodes
which do not have a corresponding Unicode character (e.g. the "alt" key), an empty string will be returned as the
property value in the returned object.

The returned object has the form { keycode : unicode, ... }.

**Syntax** ::

    var keyCodes = inputDevice.keyCodes;

    var keyCodeArray = [keyCodes.Q, keyCodes.B];
    var unicodeCharacterObject = convertToUnicode(keyCodeArray);
    // On a US keyboard unicodeCharacterObject[keyCodes.Q] will be equal to 'q',
    // while on a French keyboard, unicodeCharacterObject[keyCodes.Q] will be equal to 'a';

.. _inputdevice-issupported:

`isSupported`
-------------

**Summary**

Accepts a string describing a feature and returns a boolean informing
the game whether given features are supported in the current
configuration (depending on device, OS, browser, plugin vs canvas etc).

Currently supported features:

`POINTER_LOCK`

    The ability to lock and hide the mouse cursor and receive only
    mouse movement delta values.

**Syntax** ::

    var canLockMouse = inputDevice.isSupported("POINTER_LOCK");

**Event Listener Arguments**

``lX``
    Horizontal position of the left thumbstick. Has values from -1 to 1 inclusive.

``lY``
    Vertical position of the left thumbstick. Has values from -1 to 1 inclusive.

``lZ``
    Position of the left shoulder trigger. Has values in the range 0 to 1 inclusive.

``rX``
    Horizontal position of the right thumbstick. Has values from -1 to 1 inclusive.

``rY``
    Vertical position of the right thumbstick. Has values from -1 to 1 inclusive.

``rZ``
    Position of the right shoulder trigger. Has values in the range 0 to 1 inclusive.

Positive `lX`, `lY`, `rX`, and `rY` values correspond to right and up directions. Negative deltas correspond to left and
down directions.

A value of 0 denotes the edge of a deadzone and value of Â±1 denotes the maximum possible displacement from rest
position. The deadzones used are the defaults provided by XInput. Please see
`XInput on MSDN <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee417001(v=vs.85).aspx>`_ for further details.

**Syntax** ::

    var onFocus = function onFocusFn()
    {
        game.unpause();
    };

    inputDevice.addEventListener('focus', onFocus);


.. _inputdevice-blur:

`blur`
--------

**Summary**

Occurs when the TurbulenzEngine object loses focus - e.g. when the user clicks outside of the game area or
switches windows/tabs.

**Syntax** ::

    var onBlur = function onBlurFn()
    {
        game.pause();
    };

    inputDevice.addEventListener('blur', onBlur);


.. _inputdevice-mouselocklost:

`mouselocklost`
-----------------
