Example
-------

::

    exportevents sampleapp -v -o sampleapp\events

When exporting user information:

::

    exportevents sampleapp -v -o sampleapp\users -t users

.. NOTE::

    When exporting user information, the date range specified returns only the users acquired (i.e. who first played the
    game) during that time period.

.. NOTE::

    Entries in the downloaded user information may contain an additional `isTurbulenz` or `isDeveloper` flag.
    The `isTurbulenz` flag will be set for anyone who is a Turbulenz employee.
    The `isDeveloper` flag will be set for anyone listed as a game team member via the project :ref:`Edit tab <hub_edit_project_metadata>` on the Hub.

.. NOTE::

    When requesting a daterange which includes the current day the output files will contain data up to the current
    point in time. The filenames will reflect the exact time range which was queried, and thus running the query
    multiple times will generate different filenames with potentially different events.

.. NOTE::

    All times and dateranges should be specified in UTC, all resulting metrics also specify times in UTC.
